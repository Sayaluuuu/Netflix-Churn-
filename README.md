# Netflix-Churn-
This project aims to build a predictive machine learning model to identify customers who are likely to churn from Netflix's subscription service. Using a structured dataset of user behaviors, demographics, and subscription details, we performed data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, label encoding, and feature scaling
Two key machine learning algorithms—Random Forest Classifier  and Xgboost —were applied to classify customer churn. After used this algorithm the accuarcy for Random Forest Classifier is 0.98% and for Xgboost is 0.99% .
